        <h3>About College
        </h3>
        <p class="text-left">Biotechnology includes applications of genetic engineering in medicine, the pharmaceutical industry, and modern agriculture to provide food security, preserve and develop the environment and invest its natural resources. Biotechnology is the twenty-first-century
            revolution in life sciences. It is the global hope in providing and ensuring food security and a revolution in human health care, whether in methods of prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of all human diseases, mainly incurable diseases such
            as cancer. Or severe viral diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis C, or degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or genetic diseases. Biotechnology also benefits from applying relevant modern technologies such as nanotechnology, information
            technology, and femtoseconds within its technologies. The College of Biotechnology was established in 2006 by Republican Decree No. 283 of 2006, and 12 batches have graduated so far. The College includes selecting the best faculty members
            from medicine, pharmacy, science, agriculture, and biotechnology who work in harmony to provide a distinguished study program that offers graduates capable of competing in the labor market at the local and international levels. The efforts
            of the faculty members have combined with all the staff and students of the College to obtain the academic accreditation from the National Authority for Quality Assurance of Education and Accreditation during the year 2021. The College strives
            sustainably always to remain a leader in the various fields of biotechnology
